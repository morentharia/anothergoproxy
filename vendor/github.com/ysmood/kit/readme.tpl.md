This project is a collection of often-used io related methods with sane defaults to make coding less verbose.

## Modules

### os

Covers most used os related functions that are missing from the stdlib.

Such as the smart glob that handles git ignore properly:

{{.ExampleWalk}}

A better `Exec` alternative:

{{.ExampleExec}}

### http

The http lib from stdlib is pretty verbose to use. The `kit.Req` is a much better
alternative to use with its fluent api design. It helps to reduce the code without sacrificing performance and
flexibility. No api is hidden from the origin of http lib.

{{.ExampleReq}}

{{.ExampleServer}}
